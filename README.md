# Document-converter-pro (Streamlit)


A smart and user-friendly web app that lets you **convert PDF to Word** and **Word to PDF** — all in your browser using **Streamlit**, with no third-party uploads and no loss of formatting.

---

## Project Inspiration

This project was born out of a **real personal need**.

> My friends used to send me PDF files and ask me to convert them into editable Word documents. I always had to visit random websites, wait for uploads, and worry about privacy and ads.

So I thought — why not build my own **secure, clean, and instant** converter?  
Now I use **my own project** to handle those requests — faster and safer!


## Features

✅ **PDF to Word** conversion using `PyPDF2`  
✅ **Word to PDF** conversion using `python-docx` and `reportlab`  
✅ Instant preview of uploaded files  
✅ **In-memory file handling** (no file is saved locally or uploaded externally)  
✅ Modern and colorful UI with custom styled buttons  
✅ One-click download of converted files  
✅ Runs fully in the browser (with Streamlit)  
✅ No need to install MS Office or external software


##  Use Cases

- Students converting lecture notes from PDF to editable Word
- Freelancers generating final reports in PDF
- Office users switching between formats easily
- Anyone tired of using ad-filled online converters!
